## :mega: Overview
![overall_structure](./asset/fig_extention_teaser.jpg)
We propose **VBench**, a comprehensive benchmark suite for video generative models. We design a comprehensive and hierarchical <b>Evaluation Dimension Suite</b> to decompose "video generation quality" into multiple well-defined dimensions to facilitate fine-grained and objective evaluation. For each dimension and each content category, we carefully design a <b>Prompt Suite</b> as test cases, and sample <b>Generated Videos</b> from a set of video generation models. For each evaluation dimension, we specifically design an <b>Evaluation Method Suite</b>, which uses carefully crafted method or designated pipeline for automatic objective evaluation. We also conduct <b>Human Preference Annotation</b> for the generated videos for each dimension, and show that VBench evaluation results are <b>well aligned with human perceptions</b>. VBench can provide valuable insights from multiple perspectives. <b>VBench++</b> supports a wide range of video generation tasks, including text-to-video and image-to-video, with an adaptive Image Suite for fair evaluation across different settings. It evaluates not only technical quality but also the trustworthiness of generative models, offering a comprehensive view of model performance. We continually incorporate more video generative models into VBench to inform the community about the evolving landscape of video generation.

## :mortar_board: Evaluation Results

***See our leaderboard for the most updated ranking and numerical results (with models like Gen-3, Kling, Pika)***. [![HuggingFace](https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%A4%97%20Hugging%20Face-Leaderboard-blue)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Vchitect/VBench_Leaderboard)

  <img src="./asset/radar-open.jpg" width="48%" style="margin-right: 4%;" />
  <img src="./asset/radar-close.jpg" width="48%" />
</p>

We visualize VBench evaluation results of various publicly available video generation models, as well as Gen-2 and Pika, across 16 VBench dimensions. We normalize the results per dimension for clearer comparisons.

<a name="usage"></a>
## Usage
Use VBench to evaluate videos, and video generative models.
- A Side Note: VBench is designed for evaluating different models on a standard benchmark. Therefore, by default, we enforce evaluation on the **standard VBench prompt lists** to ensure **fair comparisons** among different video generation models. That's also why we give warnings when a required video is not found. This is done via defining the set of prompts in [VBench_full_info.json](https://github.com/Vchitect/VBench/blob/master/vbench/VBench_full_info.json). However, we understand that many users would like to use VBench to evaluate their own videos, or videos generated from prompts that does not belong to the VBench Prompt Suite, so we also added the function of **Evaluating Your Own Videos**. Simply set `mode=custom_input`, and you can evaluate your own videos.


### **[New]** Evaluate Your Own Videos
We support evaluating any video. Simply provide the path to the video file, or the path to the folder that contains your videos. There is no requirement on the videos' names.
- Note: We support customized videos / prompts for the following dimensions: `'subject_consistency', 'background_consistency', 'motion_smoothness', 'dynamic_degree', 'aesthetic_quality', 'imaging_quality'`


To evaluate videos with customized input prompt, run our script with `--mode=custom_input`:
```
python evaluate.py \
    --dimension $DIMENSION \
    --videos_path /path/to/folder_or_video/ \
    --mode=custom_input
```
alternatively you can use our command:
```
vbench evaluate \
    --dimension $DIMENSION \
    --videos_path /path/to/folder_or_video/ \
    --mode=custom_input
```

To evaluate using multiple gpus, we can use the following commands:
```
torchrun --nproc_per_node=${GPUS} --standalone evaluate.py ...args...
```
or 
```
vbench evaluate --ngpus=${GPUS} ...args...
```

### Evaluation on the Standard Prompt Suite of VBench

##### Command Line 
```bash
vbench evaluate --videos_path $VIDEO_PATH --dimension $DIMENSION
```
For example:
```bash
vbench evaluate --videos_path "sampled_videos/lavie/human_action" --dimension "human_action"
```
##### Python
```python
from vbench import VBench
my_VBench = VBench(device, <path/to/VBench_full_info.json>, <path/to/save/dir>)
my_VBench.evaluate(
    videos_path = <video_path>,
    name = <name>,
    dimension_list = [<dimension>, <dimension>, ...],
)
```
For example: 
```python
from vbench import VBench
my_VBench = VBench(device, "vbench/VBench_full_info.json", "evaluation_results")
my_VBench.evaluate(
    videos_path = "sampled_videos/lavie/human_action",
    name = "lavie_human_action",
    dimension_list = ["human_action"],
)
```

### Evaluation of Different Content Categories

##### command line 
```bash
vbench evaluate \
    --videos_path $VIDEO_PATH \
    --dimension $DIMENSION \
    --mode=vbench_category \
    --category=$CATEGORY
```
or 
```
python evaluate.py \
    --dimension $DIMENSION \
    --videos_path /path/to/folder_or_video/ \
    --mode=vbench_category
```

### Example of Evaluating VideoCrafter-1.0
We have provided scripts to download VideoCrafter-1.0 samples, and the corresponding evaluation scripts.
```
# download sampled videos
sh scripts/download_videocrafter1.sh

# evaluate VideoCrafter-1.0
sh scripts/evaluate_videocrafter1.sh
```
#### Get Final Score and Submit to Leaderboard
We have provided scripts for calculating the `Final Score`, `Quality Score`, and `Semantic Score` in the Leaderboard. You can run them locally to obtain the final scores or as a final check before submitting to the Leaderboard.
##### command line 
```bash
# Pack the evaluation results into a zip file.
cd evaluation_results
zip -r ../evaluation_results.zip .

# [Optional] get the final score of your submission file.
python scripts/cal_final_score.py --zip_file {path_to_evaluation_results.zip} --model_name {your_model_name}

## :bookmark_tabs: Sampled Videos

[![Dataset Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dataset-Download-red?logo=googlechrome&logoColor=red)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13pH95aUN-hVgybUZJBx1e_08R6xhZs5X)

To facilitate future research and to ensure full transparency, we release all the videos we sampled and used for VBench evaluation. You can download them on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13pH95aUN-hVgybUZJBx1e_08R6xhZs5X).

See detailed explanations of the sampled videos [here](https://github.com/Vchitect/VBench/tree/master/sampled_videos).

We also provide detailed setting for the models under evaluation [here](https://github.com/Vchitect/VBench/tree/master/sampled_videos#what-are-the-details-of-the-video-generation-models).

<a name="evaluation_method_suite"></a>
## :surfer: Evaluation Method Suite

To perform evaluation on one dimension, run this:
```
python evaluate.py --videos_path $VIDEOS_PATH --dimension $DIMENSION
```
- The complete list of dimensions:
    ```
    ['subject_consistency', 'background_consistency', 'temporal_flickering', 'motion_smoothness', 'dynamic_degree', 'aesthetic_quality', 'imaging_quality', 'object_class', 'multiple_objects', 'human_action', 'color', 'spatial_relationship', 'scene', 'temporal_style', 'appearance_style', 'overall_consistency']
    ```

Alternatively, you can evaluate multiple models and multiple dimensions using this script:
```
bash evaluate.sh
```
- The default sampled video paths:
    ```
    vbench_videos/{model}/{dimension}/{prompt}-{index}.mp4/gif
    ```



#### Before evaluating the temporal flickering dimension, it is necessary to filter out the static videos first.
To filter static videos in the temporal flickering dimension, run this:
```
# This only filter out static videos whose prompt matches the prompt in the temporal_flickering.
python static_filter.py --videos_path $VIDEOS_PATH
```
You can adjust the filtering scope by:
```
# 1. Change the filtering scope to consider all files inside videos_path for filtering.
python static_filter.py --videos_path $VIDEOS_PATH --filter_scope all

# 2. Specify the path to a JSON file ($filename) to consider only videos whose prompts match those listed in $filename.
python static_filter.py --videos_path $VIDEOS_PATH --filter_scope $filename
```
